    <h2>plant seeds</h2>
    <p>Ever since I started school, I loved learning. I loved to read Barbie books
      because they had a glossary in the front. I built a fort in my living room and
      stockpiled books in my toy box. I was the first to read in my preschool class,
      and as I would learn later, my parents were told to put me in a full-day
      kindergarten class (something that was not common in my area at the time).</p>

    <h2>water generously</h2>
    <p>Growing up in Northern Virginia, the education scene was extremely competitive.
      I moved schools three times before middle school, eventually making my way into
      the gifted and talented program in my school district. It was refreshing to be
      around other kids who cared about learning, who loved to play math games during
      recess, who were like me.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>wilt slightly</h2>
    <p>My last year of elementary school, I got my first concussion. Between then and
      my senior year of high school, I would have the pleasure of getting three more.
      My nervous system couldn't take it anymore and I got sick. When I was fourteen,
      I became constantly dizzy and fatigued, and I was missing 2-3 days of school a week.
      It wasn't until the middle of my freshman year that I was diagnosed with the most
      common illness you've never heard of: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, or POTS.</p>
